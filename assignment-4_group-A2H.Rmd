## Perform a Latin Hypercube (LHR) sensitivity analysis on precipitation coefficients
```{r import}
#run the sensitivity analysis on 2 coefficients of precipitation
factors = c("Pcoeff1","Pcoeff2")

# assume these P coefficients have uniform distribution
q = c("qunif", "qunif")

# set the min,max for uniform distribution

```
