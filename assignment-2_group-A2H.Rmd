# Background
## Almond conceptual model

The almond model derived from Lobell et al. (2006) is a statistical model 
calculating annual yield anomaly of almonds in California, which is based on February 
minimum temperature (Celsius degree) and January accumulated precipitation (mm).


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```
```{r library}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

## Load function(s)

Load the almond model function!

The function will process:

- Turn the daily minimum temperature and daily precipitation into monthly
results
- Calculate annual almond yield conceptual model

```{r getfunctions}
source("./R/almond_model.R")
```

## Read input data

Read the climate data in a txt format. 

- There is a column containing time information
- It includes two variables: minimum temperature and precipitation

```{r import}
clim_data_path <- here("data","clim.txt")
```

## Calculate almond yearly yield anomaly

Use the defined function to calculate almond yield of each year in California 
(units: ton/acre).

The almond yield equation (Lobell et al. 2006) is:

Y = -0.015* (Tn,2) - 0.0046* (Tn,2)^2 - 0.07* (P1) + 0.0043* (P1)^2 + 0.28

where Y is almond yield anomaly (ton/acre); Tn,2 is February minimum temperature (C); 
P1 is January precipitation (mm)

The yearly yield results will be returned to **yeild_outcomes**

```{r calculation}
yeild_outcomes <- almond_model(clim_data_path)
```

# Results


```{r}
yeild_plot <- ggplot(data=yeild_outcomes)+
  geom_line(aes(x=year,y=yeild))+
  labs(y = "Total predicted yield",
    x = "Year")+
    theme_minimal() +  
    # This centers our title and subtitle  
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust= 0.5),
          plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust= 0.5),
        axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0,vjust = .5))

```
```{r}
tmin_plot <- ggplot(data=yeild_outcomes)+
  geom_line(aes(x=year,y=yeild_temp))+
  labs(title= str_wrap("Predicted almond yield based on regression model and climate anomoly contributions",50),
       y = str_wrap("Predicted yield due to February average minimum temperature",20))+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.line.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0,vjust = .5))
```

```{r}
precip_plot <- ggplot(data=yeild_outcomes)+
  geom_line(aes(x=year,y=yeild_precip))+
  labs(y = str_wrap("Predicted yield due to January total precipitation",25))+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.line.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0,vjust = .5))
```

```{r}
library(ggpubr)

ggpubr::ggarrange(tmin_plot,precip_plot,yeild_plot,nrow = 3,align = "v")
```

# Discussion

A multiple linear regression model based on February minimum temperature and January total precipitation was used to predict annual almond yield anomalies and the contribution of each variable from 1988 to 2010. The figures show that the February minimum temperature reduces almond yield in the range of -0.4 to -0.9, with a relatively strong negative contribution until 2000, but diminishes after 2000. However, for the January precipitation, it produced positive apricot yield anomalies ranging from 0 to 2,000 tons/acre. Considering the effects of each variable and interceptions together, we obtain total annual almond yield anomalies. Total yields were highly correlated with precipitation predictions, with a similar magnitude and variation. Several peaks in the total yield prediction are also identified in the precipitation prediction, such as in 1995, 2005 and 2008. February minimum temperature accounts for only 0.05% of the magnitude of January precipitation. Therefore, total apricot production was dominated by January precipitation rather than the average minimum temperature in February.
